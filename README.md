# Overview of the project
Project Name: House Price Prediction Using Boston Dataset

This project is focused on predicting house prices using a machine learning model trained on the Boston Housing Dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various features in the dataset.

# Features 

- __Data Loading and Preprocessing:__ The project begins with loading the dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Includes visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the data features.
- __Model Building:__ Implements machine learning models including linear regression to predict house prices.
- __Model Evaluation:__ Evaluates the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and cross-validation.
- __Feature Importance:__ Analyzes the importance of various features in predicting house prices.

# Linear Regression
__Definition:__
Linear Regression is a statistical method used for predicting a target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). The relationship between the target and predictor variables is modeled using a linear equation.

Equation: For a simple linear regression with one predictor variable, the model can be represented as:

𝑦=
𝛽
0
+
𝛽
1
𝑥
+
𝜖
y=β 
0
​
 +β 
1
​
 x+ϵ

where:

𝑦
is the target variable.

x is the predictor variable.

𝛽
0 is the y-intercept (the value of 
𝑦
y when 
𝑥
x is 0).

𝛽
1
​ is the slope of the line (the change in 
𝑦
y for a one-unit change in 
𝑥
x).


ϵ is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values).
